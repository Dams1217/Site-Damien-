      <blockquote>"I don’t aim to entertain. I aim to make people feel." — Damien Vonlanthen</blockquote>
      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>I am Damien Vonlanthen. Author, screenwriter, actor. I started writing because some things could not be expressed otherwise. Because there were silences too heavy, memories too fragile, truths too uncomfortable. Writing became a vital need, a way to hold reality under tension.</p>
      <p>Often, everything begins with a fragment: an image, a news article, a stolen phrase. Then come the characters — their shadows, their scars. I deeply believe that fiction can express what ordinary language no longer allows. <em>HERITIERS</em> was born from a need to transmit — and from the fear that some truths might die with those who carry them.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="approach">
      <h2>Author’s Approach</h2>
      <p>I write stories where the political crosses paths with the intimate. What interests me are not heroes, but survivors. Those who carry invisible burdens. My style is tense, raw, without embellishment. Every silence counts. Every look weighs something. I seek out the grey areas, the fractures. I want to make what is being erased exist again.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="universe">
      <h2>Universe</h2>
      <p>My universe is anchored in psychological thrillers, espionage, and human drama. These are dark but human stories. Stories about memory, responsibility, silence, and transmission. I often draw from real events or forgotten testimonies. Emotion is never gratuitous. It is always tied to a truth we’re trying to bring to light.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="influences">
      <h2>Influences</h2>
      <p>I am influenced by filmmakers like Paul Greengrass, Kathryn Bigelow, Denis Villeneuve, Olivier Assayas, Florian Zeller, and Costa-Gavras. Artists who know how to weave together tension and emotion, realism and intimacy. In literature, writers such as Don Winslow, Roberto Saviano, Delphine de Vigan, Laurent Mauvignier, and Emmanuel Carrère are major references for me.</p>

      <h2>Works</h2>
      <h3>HERITIERS</h3>
      <p><strong>Genre:</strong> Contemporary Thriller / Espionage<br>
      <strong>Duration:</strong> 1h50<br>
      <strong>Language:</strong> French<br>
      <strong>Pitch:</strong> “In a world where memory is erased faster than people are killed, three survivors of a buried military operation will attempt to transmit a truth no one wants to hear.”</p>
      <p><strong>Synopsis:</strong> Alex Dumont, a former covert agent, resurfaces after years in the shadows. Alongside Mikael and Céline Vega, he attempts to uncover a truth hidden by HYDRA, a secret operation. It’s a race against forgetfulness, against the silence imposed by a faceless system.</p>

    <section id="note">
      <h2>Director’s Note</h2>
      <p><em>HERITIERS</em> is not an action film in the spectacular sense. It’s a film about memory, transmission, and the invisible legacy left to those who refuse to forget. What interests me are the cracks, the silences, the glances. Making a film is entering a living memory and giving it a face. HERITIERS is a refusal to be erased.</p>

    <section id="biography">
      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>Damien Vonlanthen is an author, screenwriter, and actor. He came to cinema not through school, but out of necessity. Writing, for him, is not a choice — it is an urgency. A vital need to give shape to a deep sensitivity, forged through a dense and demanding personal journey.</p>
      <p>His stories — often dark, tense, and lucid — unfold in the world of thrillers, action, or road-movies, following characters who keep moving forward despite loss, despite their wounds. These are stories that do not necessarily end well, but always carry something true.</p>
      <p>His first feature film, <strong>HERITIERS</strong>, explores the grey zones of collective memory and personal transmission. He is also developing two new screenplays and working in parallel as an actor on several upcoming projects.</p>
      <p>What drives him is destiny. He is not here by chance. He moves forward because something inside pushes him — a need to speak, to transmit, to create. For him, cinema is a space for truth, tension, and embodiment.</p>
