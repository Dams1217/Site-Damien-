  <section id="bio">
    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>I am Damien Vonlanthen. Author, screenwriter, actor.</p>
    <p>I started writing because some things cannot be expressed any other way. There were heavy silences, fragile memories, truths that were too uncomfortable. Writing became a necessity — a vital act, a way of holding reality in tension.</p>
    <p>My journey is unique. I have no formal artistic background. My path is forged by lived experience, emotional depth, and a burning need to express what words often fail to capture. This is my first film — but many others are already on their way. I am also collaborating with various directors on projects as an actor. Nothing has yet been filmed, but everything is already alive.</p>
    <p>Destiny led me here. Every project I undertake is a part of a much larger process: a personal evolution, a transmission, a connection. I write from what I carry. And I act from what I’ve survived.</p>

  <section id="approach">
    <h2>Artistic Approach</h2>
    <p>I work on narratives where intimate wounds intersect with collective memory. My films explore silence, emotional legacy, and hidden grief. I write as a way to heal, to share, and to leave a trace of what might otherwise disappear.</p>
    <p>I also write road trip and action stories — narratives with movement, intensity, sometimes with no comforting resolution. But whether still or explosive, everything I create comes from the same place: a deeply rooted emotional truth.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="universe">
    <h2>Universe</h2>
    <p>I’m drawn to fragile characters, survivors, silent heirs of past generations. My cinematic universe speaks in nuances, in shadow and stillness. It’s not there to explain — it’s there to make you feel.</p>
    <p>I believe cinema can be powerful without being loud. I search for meaning behind glances, for stories behind absences. My films question, disturb, and — I hope — leave something behind once the screen goes dark.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="influences">
    <h2>Influences</h2>
    <p>I admire filmmakers like Xavier Dolan, Asghar Farhadi, Nanni Moretti, the Dardenne brothers. Artists who capture the invisible with rare humanity. Their work helped me understand that emotion is a language in itself — and one that I want to master.</p>
    <p>In writing, I’m influenced by the rawness of Annie Ernaux, the introspection of Marguerite Duras, and the cinematic energy of American screenwriting. I stand between the poetic and the visceral — because both are needed to tell the truth.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="works">
    <h2>Works</h2>
    <p><strong>HERITIERS</strong> (in development): A feature film about emotional legacy and unspeakable truths passed down through generations. A story of silence, family, and inner revolt. This is the beginning — but not the end. Other scripts are in the works, and collaborations as an actor are multiplying. It’s only the beginning of a much deeper journey.</p>
