  <section id="bio">
    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>I am Damien Vonlanthen. Author, screenwriter, actor.</p>
    <p>I began writing because some things simply couldn't be expressed any other way. Because there were silences too heavy, memories too fragile, truths too uncomfortable. Writing became a vital need, an act of putting reality under tension.</p>
    <p>My writing often begins with a fragment: a photo, a newspaper clipping, a sentence heard in passing. Then come the characters, their flaws, their burdens. I deeply believe that fiction can express what discourse no longer manages to articulate. <em>HERITIERS</em> was born from that urge — the need to pass on, and also from the fear that some truths might vanish with those who carry them.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="approach">
    <h2>Artistic Approach</h2>
    <p>I work on stories where intimate stakes intersect with collective memory, stories that echo the invisible wounds we carry and the silence passed down through generations. I try to give a voice to the unspoken, to make the fragile resonate. My writing is nourished by my own emotional journey, by what I have lived through and continue to live.</p>
    <p>Beyond drama, I also write action and road trip films that often unfold with a raw emotional arc and unexpected turns. I don’t seek to fit into a genre, but rather to push its limits in service of what I have to say.</p>

  <section id="universe">
    <h2>Universe</h2>
    <p>The stories I create delve into the cracks of memory, family heritage, and personal resilience. I am drawn to characters who carry unspeakable stories, who seek to free themselves through confrontation or encounter. My cinema is not afraid of stillness, discomfort, or mystery — it feeds on it.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="influences">
    <h2>Influences</h2>
    <p>I’m inspired by filmmakers like Nanni Moretti, the Dardenne brothers, Xavier Dolan, and Asghar Farhadi — authors of raw, humanistic, and intimate cinema. I admire their ability to capture the emotional truth of their characters with modesty and intensity. In literature, Marguerite Duras and Annie Ernaux have deeply influenced my sense of introspection and poetic detail.</p>

  <section id="works">
    <h2>Works</h2>
    <p><strong>HERITIERS</strong> (In development): A film that explores the weight of memory and the necessity of transmission. It’s my first film, but not the last — several other projects are in the works, including feature-length scripts and collaborations as an actor with various directors.</p>
