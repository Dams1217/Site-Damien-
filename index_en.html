    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>I am Damien Vonlanthen. Author, screenwriter, actor. I began writing because some things could not be expressed otherwise. Because there were silences too heavy, memories too fragile, truths too uncomfortable. Writing became a vital need, an act of tensioning reality.</p>

    <p>My writing often begins with a fragment: a photo, a news clipping, a heard phrase. Then come the characters, their flaws, their burdens. I deeply believe fiction can convey what speeches can no longer express. <em>HERITIERS</em> was born from this urge to transmit — and from the fear that some truths might vanish with those who carry them.</p>

    <h2>Author’s Approach</h2>
    <p>I focus on stories where intimate challenges intersect with larger societal stakes. My goal is not to entertain, but to move — to shake something within. I come from a life filled with intensity, emotional experiences, and constant personal development. Acting and writing allow me to transform all of this into meaning.</p>

    <p>This is my first film. Others are on the way. I’m also involved as an actor in future projects with various directors. Nothing has been filmed yet, but everything is in motion. I feel destined for this path — for writing, for performing, for conveying emotions with honesty and urgency.</p>
