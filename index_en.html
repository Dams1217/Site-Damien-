      <blockquote>"I don’t aim to entertain. I aim to make you feel." — Damien Vonlanthen</blockquote>
      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>I’m Damien Vonlanthen. Author, screenwriter, actor. I started writing because some things couldn’t be expressed otherwise. Because there were silences too heavy, memories too fragile, truths too uncomfortable. Writing became a vital act, a tension with reality.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="approach">
      <h2>Creative Approach</h2>
      <p>I work on stories where intimate struggles cross paths with collective tensions. I’m not interested in heroes, but in those who wrestle with the world and themselves. My writing is driven by a need to illuminate the fractures that shape us.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="universe">
      <h2>Universe</h2>
      <p>I draw from real events, testimonies, and living memory. My stories live in tense and shadowed spaces, but they’re never hopeless. They’re built on silence, memory, transmission, and responsibility — pillars that hold the weight of what’s unspoken.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="influences">
      <h2>Influences</h2>
      <p>I find inspiration in filmmakers like Paul Greengrass, Kathryn Bigelow, Denis Villeneuve, Costa-Gavras, and David Fincher — directors who balance drama, humanity, and political conscience. I also take cues from authors like Don Winslow and Roberto Saviano, who fuse raw reality with powerful storytelling.</p>

      <h2>Works</h2>
      <h3>HERITIERS</h3>
      <p><strong>Genre:</strong> Contemporary Thriller / Espionage<br>
      <strong>Duration:</strong> 1h50<br>
      <strong>Language:</strong> French<br>
      <strong>Pitch:</strong> "In a world where memory is erased faster than people are killed, three survivors of a buried military operation fight to reveal a truth no one wants to hear."</p>
      <p><strong>Synopsis:</strong> Alex Dumont, a former covert operative, resurfaces after years underground. Joined by Mikael and Céline Vega, he seeks to expose HYDRA, a secret operation long buried. It’s a race against systemic silence — a battle not just for justice, but for memory itself.</p>

    <section id="note">
      <h2>Director’s Note</h2>
      <p><em>HERITIERS</em> is not a classic action film. It’s a psychological thriller about the invisible legacy left by silence. I focus on what breaks, what resists, and what survives. This story is a refusal — a refusal to let history vanish.</p>
