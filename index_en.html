      <blockquote>“I don’t aim to entertain. I aim to make you feel.” — Damien Vonlanthen</blockquote>
      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>I’m Damien Vonlanthen. Author, screenwriter, actor. I started writing because some things couldn’t be expressed otherwise. Because there were silences too heavy, memories too fragile, truths too uncomfortable. Writing became a vital act, a tension with reality.</p>
      <p>My writing often starts with a fragment: an image, a news article, a sentence overheard. Then come the characters — their shadows, their scars. I deeply believe that fiction can express what structured speech can no longer hold. <em>HERITIERS</em> was born out of this need to pass something on — and the fear that some truths might die with those who carry them.</p>

    <section id="approach">
      <h2>Creative Approach</h2>
      <p>I tell stories where the political meets the personal. I’m not interested in heroes — I’m interested in survivors. People who carry invisible weight. My style is tense, raw, stripped down. Every silence matters. Every glance holds weight. I seek out gray areas. Cracks. I want to make visible what’s been erased.</p>

    <section id="universe">
      <h2>Universe</h2>
      <p>I work in the space of psychological thrillers, espionage, and human drama. These are dark, but deeply human stories. They deal with memory, responsibility, silence, and transmission. Often inspired by real events or hidden testimonies, they aim to bring emotion only when emotion is earned — and truth demands it.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="influences">
      <h2>Influences</h2>
      <p>My influences include filmmakers such as Paul Greengrass, Kathryn Bigelow, Denis Villeneuve, Olivier Assayas, Florian Zeller, and Costa-Gavras. I admire creators who balance dramatic tension with human and political depth. In literature, I’m inspired by Don Winslow, Roberto Saviano, Delphine de Vigan, Emmanuel Carrère, and Laurent Mauvignier.</p>

      <h2>Works</h2>
      <h3>HERITIERS</h3>
      <p><strong>Genre:</strong> Contemporary Thriller / Espionage<br>
      <strong>Duration:</strong> 1h50<br>
      <strong>Language:</strong> French<br>
      <strong>Pitch:</strong> "In a world where memory is erased faster than people are killed, three survivors of a buried military operation fight to reveal a truth no one wants to hear."</p>
      <p><strong>Synopsis:</strong> Alex Dumont, a former covert operative, resurfaces after years underground. Joined by Mikael and Céline Vega, he seeks to expose HYDRA, a secret operation long buried. It’s a race against systemic silence — a battle not just for justice, but for memory itself.</p>

      <h2>Director’s Note</h2>
      <p><em>HERITIERS</em> is not a conventional action film. It’s a story about memory, legacy, and the invisible burdens left behind by systems that erase rather than kill. I’m drawn to fractures, silences, and the way a look can carry what words cannot. Making this film is a refusal — a refusal to forget.</p>
